His chest heaves violently as he begins to scream, <S>the man yells: I can\u2019t breathe\u2014there\u2019s no air!<E> his voice breaking as his oxygen supply fails. The vast blackness of space surrounds him, dotted with distant stars and the curved blue edge of Earth far below, while the cold metallic hull of the spacecraft looms just out of reach. <AUDCAP>Muffled, distorted male shouting filtered through a helmet radio, punctuated by frantic gasping breaths, rapid warning beeps from a failing life-support system, and a deep, oppressive silence between alarms.<ENDAUDCAP>",
