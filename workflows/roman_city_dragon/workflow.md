# Roman City Dragon

## Description
A dragon is flying over an ancient Roman city and burns it to the ground.

# Steps
1. First step was creating the image of a dragon using Qwen Image. 
    - This involved getting a prompt from ChatGPT and Gemini 2.5 Pro. 
    - Tried using Flux Dev and Flux Krea for the image, but Qwen Image was the best.
