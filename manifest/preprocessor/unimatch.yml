category: Optical Flow
class: UnimatchDetector
description: Unified correspondence matching framework for accurate optical flow with
  forward, backward, and bidirectional options. State-of-the-art flow estimation handling
  occlusions and large motions. Supports multiple flow directions for comprehensive
  motion analysis. Perfect for advanced video effects, motion compensation, and temporal
  consistency.
module: src.auxillary.unimatch
name: UniMatch Optical Flow
parameters:
- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.
  display_name: Detection Resolution
  name: detect_resolution
  options:
  - name: Standard
    value: 512
  - name: High Definition
    value: 1024
  - name: Current Image
    value: 0
  type: category
- default: INTER_CUBIC
  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
  display_name: Upscale Method
  name: upscale_method
  options:
  - name: Nearest Neighbor
    value: INTER_NEAREST
  - name: Linear
    value: INTER_LINEAR
  - name: Cubic
    value: INTER_CUBIC
  - name: Lanczos
    value: INTER_LANCZOS4
  type: category
- default: false
  description: When enabled, computes optical flow from the current frame to the previous
    frame (backward in time). Useful for motion analysis and tracking objects moving
    backward through the sequence.
  display_name: Predict Backward Flow
  name: pred_bwd_flow
  type: bool
- default: false
  description: When enabled, computes optical flow in both forward and backward directions
    simultaneously. Provides complete motion information but requires more processing
    time and memory.
  display_name: Predict Bidirectional Flow
  name: pred_bidir_flow
  type: bool
supports_image: false
supports_video: true
