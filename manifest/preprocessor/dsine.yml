category: Depth and Normal
class: DsineDetector
description: Estimates surface normal vectors for every pixel, showing the orientation
  of surfaces in 3D space. Uses deep learning to predict accurate normals even for
  complex geometries. Essential for relighting, 3D reconstruction, and understanding
  surface structure.
