class: DiffusionEdgeDetector
description: Advanced edge detection powered by diffusion models for high-quality,
  semantically-aware edge extraction. Produces cleaner, more perceptually meaningful
  edges compared to traditional methods. Excellent for artistic applications and complex
  scene understanding.
