category: Depth and Normal
class: DepthAnythingV2Detector
description: Enhanced version of Depth Anything with improved accuracy and finer detail
  preservation. Offers multiple model sizes to balance between speed and quality.
  Better at handling challenging scenes with transparent objects, reflections, and
  complex depth variations.
module: src.auxillary.depth_anything_v2

parameters:
- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.

  description: The Vision Transformer encoder model size to use. Larger models (ViTL,
    ViTG) provide better accuracy but require more memory and processing time. Smaller
    models (VITS, ViTB) are faster but may be less accurate.
