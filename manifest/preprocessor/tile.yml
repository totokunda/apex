category: Color
class: TileDetector
description: Creates smooth color transitions using pyramid downsampling and upsampling.
  Repeatedly reduces then enlarges the image to blur fine details while preserving
  major color regions. Produces painterly, posterized effects with soft color gradients.
  Great for simplifying images, creating base layers, and stylized color blocking.
module: src.auxillary.tile
name: Tile Resample
parameters:
- default: 3
  description: The number of pyramid upsampling iterations. More iterations create
    stronger blur and smoother color transitions. Each iteration doubles the scale,
    so 3 iterations provides 8x downsampling before upsampling back.

- default: INTER_CUBIC
  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
