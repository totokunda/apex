category: Face and Pose
class: DwposeDetector
description: Comprehensive whole-body pose estimation capturing body, hands, and facial
  keypoints in a single unified model. Fast and accurate for real-time applications.
  Ideal for animation reference, motion analysis, and character pose extraction with
  granular control over which components to detect.
module: src.auxillary.dwpose
name: DWPose
parameters:
- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.
  display_name: Detection Resolution
  name: detect_resolution
  options:
  - name: Standard
    value: 512
  - name: High Definition
    value: 1024
  - name: Current Image
    value: 0
  type: category
- default: true
  description: When enabled, detects and displays body keypoints including torso,
    arms, and legs. This is typically the main component of pose estimation.
  display_name: Include Body
  name: include_body
  type: bool
- default: false
  description: When enabled, detects and displays detailed hand keypoints for finger
    and palm positions. Useful for capturing hand gestures and fine hand movements.
  display_name: Include Hands
  name: include_hand
  type: bool
- default: false
  description: When enabled, detects and displays facial keypoints including eyes,
    nose, mouth, and facial landmarks. Useful for capturing facial expressions and
    head orientation.
  display_name: Include Face
  name: include_face
  type: bool
- default: INTER_CUBIC
  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
  display_name: Upscale Method
  name: upscale_method
  options:
  - name: Nearest Neighbor
    value: INTER_NEAREST
  - name: Linear
    value: INTER_LINEAR
  - name: Cubic
    value: INTER_CUBIC
  - name: Lanczos
    value: INTER_LANCZOS4
  type: category
- default: false
  description: Applies XinSR stick scaling algorithm to normalize the pose skeleton
    representation. Useful for maintaining consistent pose proportions across different
    image sizes.
  display_name: XinSR Stick Scaling
