category: Face and Pose
class: MediapipeFaceDetector
description: Real-time 3D face mesh detection with 468 facial landmarks using Google's
  MediaPipe framework. Tracks detailed facial features including eyes, eyebrows, nose,
  lips, and face contour. Optimized for speed and works well even on mobile devices.
  Perfect for AR filters, facial animation, and expression analysis.

  description: The minimum confidence threshold for face detection (0.0 to 1.0). Higher
    values reduce false positives but may miss less clear faces. Lower values detect
    more faces but may include false detections.
