category: Line
class: MLSDdetector
description: Mobile Line Segment Detection optimized for detecting straight lines
  and architectural features. Lightweight and fast while maintaining accuracy. Excels
  at finding structural lines in buildings, rooms, and geometric objects. Ideal for
  architectural visualization, perspective correction, and wireframe extraction.
module: src.auxillary.mlsd
name: M-LSD Line Detection
parameters:
- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

  description: The value threshold for line segment detection. Controls the minimum
    confidence required for detecting line segments. Lower values detect more lines
    including faint ones, higher values detect only strong, clear lines.

  type: float
- default: 0.1
  description: The distance threshold for line segment merging. Controls how close
    line segments need to be to be merged into a single line. Lower values keep line
    segments separate, higher values merge nearby segments.
  display_name: Distance Threshold
  max: 1.0
  min: 0.0

- default: INTER_CUBIC
  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
