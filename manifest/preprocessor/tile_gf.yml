class: TTPlanet_Tile_Detector_GF
description: Advanced tile processing using guided filter for edge-preserving smoothing.
  Combines downsampling with intelligent filtering that maintains important edges
  while blurring textures. Better edge preservation than simple tile methods. Ideal
  for stylization that needs to keep subject boundaries sharp while simplifying detail.
module: src.auxillary.tile
name: Tile Guided Filter
parameters:
- default: 2.0
  description: The downscaling factor before processing. Higher values create more
    aggressive downsampling and stronger simplification effects. A value of 2.0 reduces
    dimensions by half.

  name: scale_factor
  type: float
- default: 1.0
  description: The strength of Gaussian blur applied during preprocessing. Higher
    values create smoother, more blurred results. 1.0 is standard blur strength.

  type: float
- default: 3
  description: The radius of the guided filter kernel in pixels. Larger radius values
    preserve more edge structure while smoothing. Typical values are 1-10.

  description: The regularization parameter for the guided filter. Controls edge preservation
    versus smoothing. Lower values preserve more edges, higher values create smoother
    results.
