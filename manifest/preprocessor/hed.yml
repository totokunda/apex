class: HEDdetector
description: Holistically-Nested Edge Detection using deep learning to identify object
  boundaries and meaningful edges. Produces thicker, more object-aware edges than
  traditional methods. Great for converting photos to sketch-like representations
  and understanding scene structure.

- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

  description: When enabled, applies additional filtering to remove noise and produce
    cleaner edge detection results. Recommended for images with complex backgrounds.

  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
