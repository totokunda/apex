class: BinaryDetector
description: Converts images to pure black and white using threshold-based segmentation.
  Pixels above the threshold become white, below become black. Useful for creating
  high-contrast masks, extracting silhouettes, or preparing images for stylized effects.

name: Binary Threshold
parameters:
- default: 0
  description: The threshold value for binary conversion. Pixels above this value
    become white, below become black. Set to 0 to use automatic Otsu thresholding.
