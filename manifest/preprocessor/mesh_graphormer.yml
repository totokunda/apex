class: MeshGraphormerDetector
description: Advanced 3D hand mesh reconstruction from single images using graph convolutional
  networks. Recovers detailed 3D hand geometry including finger positions and joints.
  Excellent for hand tracking, gesture recognition, sign language analysis, and creating
  hand animations.

  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.

  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.

  description: The amount of padding (in pixels) added around the detected hand bounding
    box. More padding captures more context around the hand but may include unwanted
    background. Less padding focuses tightly on the hand.
