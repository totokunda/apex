category: Face and Pose
class: OpenposeDetector
description: Industry-standard multi-person pose estimation detecting body, hands,
  and face keypoints simultaneously. The original and most widely-used pose detection
  system. Robust multi-person tracking even in crowded scenes. Essential for motion
  capture, fitness analysis, dance videos, and character animation reference.
module: src.auxillary.open_pose
name: OpenPose
parameters:
- default: 512
  description: The resolution used for detection and inference. Higher resolutions
    provide more detail but require more processing time and memory.
  display_name: Detection Resolution
  name: detect_resolution
  options:
  - name: Standard
    value: 512
  - name: High Definition
    value: 1024
  - name: Current Image
    value: 0
  type: category
- default: true
  description: When enabled, detects and displays body keypoints including torso,
    arms, and legs. This is the primary component of full-body pose estimation.
  display_name: Include Body
  name: include_body
  type: bool
- default: true
  description: When enabled, detects and displays detailed hand keypoints for both
    left and right hands. Captures finger positions and hand gestures.
  display_name: Include Hands
  name: include_hand
  type: bool
- default: true
  description: When enabled, detects and displays detailed facial keypoints including
    eyes, nose, mouth, and facial contours. Useful for capturing facial expressions.
  display_name: Include Face
  name: include_face
  type: bool
- default: INTER_CUBIC
  description: The interpolation method used when resizing images. Bicubic and Lanczos
    provide smoother results, while Nearest Neighbor preserves sharp edges.
  display_name: Upscale Method
  name: upscale_method
  options:
  - name: Nearest Neighbor
    value: INTER_NEAREST
  - name: Linear
    value: INTER_LINEAR
  - name: Cubic
    value: INTER_CUBIC
  - name: Lanczos
    value: INTER_LANCZOS4
  type: category
- default: false
  description: Applies XinSR stick scaling algorithm to normalize the pose skeleton
    representation. Helps maintain consistent proportions across different image resolutions.
