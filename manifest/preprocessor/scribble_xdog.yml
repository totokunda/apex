class: ScribbleXDogDetector
description: Extended Difference of Gaussians algorithm for creating artistic scribble
  effects with adjustable density. Uses advanced edge detection to produce variable-width
  sketch lines. Threshold control allows balancing between detailed, dense scribbles
  and sparse, clean lines. Great for non-photorealistic rendering and artistic stylization.

  description: The threshold parameter for the Extended Difference of Gaussians algorithm.
    Controls the sensitivity of edge detection. Lower values detect more edges and
    produce denser scribbles, higher values produce sparser, cleaner lines.
