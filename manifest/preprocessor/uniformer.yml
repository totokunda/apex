category: Segmentation
class: UniformerSegmentor
description: Unified transformer architecture for semantic segmentation with both
  local and global attention. Accurately segments scenes into semantic categories
  like sky, road, buildings, vegetation, etc. Excellent balance of accuracy and efficiency.
  Ideal for scene parsing, autonomous driving visualization, and understanding spatial
  layout.
